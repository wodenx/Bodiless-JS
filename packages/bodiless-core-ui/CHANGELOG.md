## [0.0.54](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/bodiless-js/compare/v0.0.53...v0.0.54) (2020-08-24)


### Features

* **fclasses:** Allow adding/removing classes conditionally via fclasses ([#440](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/bodiless-js/issues/440)) ([d3d522b](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/bodiless-js/commit/d3d522b22e88e39a86f7c36fb21cd7b0dfd978da))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **fclasses:** chaining support is removed from addClasses and removeClasses. If your code contains chained addClasses/removeClasses, you need to replace the chaining with flow/flowIf or any other helpers that provides functional composition.
For example, when you have in your code
```
addClasses('classA').removeClasses('classB')
```
you need to change it to
```
flow(
  addClasses('classA'),
  removeClasses('classB'),
)
```
